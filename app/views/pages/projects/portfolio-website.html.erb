      <p class="dark:text-slate-300 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I built this site to showcase my work and experiment with the static-site-builder gem I created. It's also a bit of a testbed—I use it to try out new ideas and see how they feel in practice.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The entire thing was built with Cursor, which has been a game-changer for rapid iteration. The animated particles and glassmorphic design came from wanting something that felt modern but not overdone. I wanted it to feel polished without being flashy.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It's deployed as static files on Cloudflare Pages, which makes it blazing fast, secure, and effectively free to host. Updates are effortless—just push to git and the site rebuilds automatically. That kind of simplicity is exactly what I set out to achieve with the gem.
