      <p class="dark:text-slate-300 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I built this gem because I was tired of the complexity that comes with most static site generators. I wanted something that felt like Rails but produced static HTML—no server required, just compile and deploy.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-300 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The real challenge was making JavaScript work properly in a static context. Most generators either ignore JS entirely or force you into their specific bundling setup. I wanted flexibility—use Importmap if you want simplicity, or ESBuild/Webpack/Vite if you need more power. Same with templates: ERB for familiarity, or Phlex if you prefer component-based views.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-300 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This site itself is built with it, and I use it for client projects when they need something fast and secure without the overhead of a full Rails app. It's become my go-to for portfolios, documentation sites, and marketing pages.
