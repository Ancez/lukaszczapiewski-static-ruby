      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I built this gem because I was tired of the complexity that comes with most static site generators. I wanted something that felt like Rails but produced static HTML—no server required, just compile and deploy.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The gem uses ActionView to render ERB files, giving you Rails-like layouts, pages, and partials without a full Rails application. It's intentionally simple—no built-in JavaScript bundlers or CSS frameworks. Instead, you add your own tools as needed, with setup guides provided in the documentation.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Features include automatic sitemap generation, helper auto-loading, template path annotations for debugging, and a live reload development server with WebSocket support. The generated site has no runtime dependency on the gem—everything compiles to static HTML ready for deployment to any static hosting service.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This site itself is built with it, and I use it for client projects when they need something fast and secure without a full Rails application. It's become my go-to for portfolios, documentation sites, and marketing pages.
