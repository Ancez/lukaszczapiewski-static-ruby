        I built this for my Omarchy setup—a multi-monitor workstation where YouTube Music runs on a dedicated screen. The problem was simple: I'd discover great music while working, but by the time I switched windows to like it, I'd already forgotten or moved on to the next track.

      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The extension automatically likes songs when the browser gains focus, so I can just glance over and the track gets saved. I added keyboard shortcuts for manual control and duplicate prevention because I'd sometimes switch windows multiple times during a single song. It's a small thing, but it's made music discovery so much smoother.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I open-sourced it because I figured other people might have the same workflow. It's one of those tools that solves a very specific problem, but when you have that problem, it's invaluable.
