      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Working at mmtm.io means tackling various problems and client needs every sprint. I help with scoping and work on everything from backend systems to user interfaces, each project bringing its own challenges and requirements. The variety keeps things interesting and pushes me to learn quickly.
      </p>
      <p class="dark:text-slate-400 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The tech stack is primarily Ruby on Rails, with Hotwire for rapid development. I also work with React and Vue.js for some frontends, and occasionally with microservices using RabbitMQ and Kubernetes. The constant learning and problem-solving is what I love most about mmtm.
